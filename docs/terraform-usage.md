# Terraform Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use and customize the Terraform configuration for our project.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.0.0 or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Access to the project's Terraform state backend (if using remote state)

## Initializing Terraform

1. Navigate to the `infra` directory:
   ```
   cd infra
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

## Planning and Applying

1. Review the changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

2. Apply the changes:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

## Customizing Variables

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `infra` directory.
2. Override any variables defined in `variables.tf`. For example:
   ```hcl
   aws_region = "us-west-2"
   project_name = "my-custom-project"
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Use remote state storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking).
2. Use workspaces for managing multiple environments.
3. Always review the plan before applying changes.
4. Use version control for your Terraform code.
5. Regularly update Terraform and provider versions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your AWS credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.
2. Check the Terraform and AWS provider versions.
3. Review the error messages in the Terraform output.
